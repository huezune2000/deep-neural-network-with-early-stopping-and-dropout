# deep-neural-network-with-early-stopping-and-dropout


# Description:
### Using predictive models can be benefial to the healthcare industry. New technologies, such as deep neural network, can help healthcare professionals to predict cells, if they were maglignant or benign. It takes years of training for physicians to be able to diagnose cancer. Having a reliable predictive model can positively impact the efficiency of healthcare. By no means can the model replace physicians, predictive models can help physicians to prioritize their workload and focus on high-risk patients. This interesting project will use deep neural network with early stopping and dropout on the cancer dataset.


# Project Objective:
### To develop a predictive model using deep neural network to predict if the cell is malignant or benign. The target feature or the y-variable is "benign_0__mal_1".

# Process:
### This interesting project will start off with basic descriptive analysis, followed by exploratory data analysis, data visualization, preprocessing the data using a scaler, setting up train & test data, finally fit the data into the model. This project will be concluded with metrics, such as classification report and confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance.

# Potential Impact
### Potential positive impact included healthcare resouce allocation strategy, improve efficiency and the process of diagnosing a patient, and help physicians to prioritize their workload. Early recognition and diagnosis can significantly improve the chance of survival and recovery
